UI requirements

Use JS and Ext-JS to code a front-end for the "simple.server" to-do list app.  The web app must use the simple.server API.

A user should be able to:

 -See all of her lists in alphabetical order
 -Expand and collapse lists
 -Retitle a list
 -Create a new list
 -Delete a list
 -Reorder items in the list (bonus points for drag and drop!)

Within a list, a user should be able to:
 -See all the items of the list
 -See the status (done/not done) of each item
 -Edit the title of an item
 -Add a new item
 -Delete an item
 -Toggle the status of an item
